StatelessWidget
A StatelessWidget is immutable and designed for static content that does not change during the widget's lifecycle. It cannot hold or manage state, as its appearance and behavior are entirely dependent on the data passed from its parent. This makes it ideal for simple UI elements like labels, icons, or layouts where updates are triggered externally, such as through state management libraries like Provider. Stateless widgets are lightweight and render quickly, making them suitable for components that do not require interaction or dynamic updates.

StatefulWidget
In contrast, a StatefulWidget can hold mutable state using a State object, allowing the widget to rebuild dynamically in response to user interactions or other events. This is achieved through the setState() method, which notifies the framework of changes and triggers a UI rebuild with the updated state. Stateful widgets are best suited for interactive components, such as counters, forms, or toggles, where internal data changes over time. Although they are slightly heavier than stateless widgets, they provide the flexibility required for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
